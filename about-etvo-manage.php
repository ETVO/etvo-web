        Inside a block, you might find:
      </figcaption>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>attributes</b>, such as a title and a description,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>other blocks</b>, such as a Call to Action or Social Media Icons,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>and even collections of blocks</b>, such as Services or Projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </figure>
    <p>etvo-manage is actually the CMS used by this very website. Pretty much of the content you find in the homepage can be easily edited using the system. Although there is no comparison between etvo-manage and top-class software like WordPress or Joomla, it does the job, and cuts some shortcuts through the forest of over-functionality these systems offer.</p>
